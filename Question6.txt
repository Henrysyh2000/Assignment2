Because according to the definition of big O complexity, the constant is always omitted. 
Therefore, if we take the actual run time n^2 and 50nlog(n), we will find that 100^2 = 50*100log(100)
However, we can always find c = 50, n0 = 100 such that n^2 >= nlog(n) for all n >= n0.
Therefore, O(n^2) > O(nlog(n)).
